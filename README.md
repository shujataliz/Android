If you wish to use this code, bear in mind a few things:

The projects are set up to be built by Ant, not by Eclipse. If you wish to use the code with Eclipse, you will need to create a suitable Android Eclipse project and import the code and other assets.

You should delete build.xml from the project, then run android update project -p ... (where ... is the path to a project of interest) on those projects you wish to use, so the build files are updated for your Android SDK version.
